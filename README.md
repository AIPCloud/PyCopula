# PyCopula - Study dependencies with copulas
PyCopula is an easy-to-use Python library that allows you to study random variables dependencies with copulas.

## Development

Currently, there are only a few features implemented in the library, which are the basics components for copula handling :

- Creating Archimedean and Gaussian copulas
- 3D plot of PDF and CDF
- Estimation of archimedean copulas parameter (Canonical Maximum Likelihood)

In the future, I plan to release the following features :

- More inference methods and statistical tools
- Goodness-of-fit
- Copula selection with criterions and statistical testing
- Examples of applications in real world with open data
