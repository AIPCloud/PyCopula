Simulation
============

For each copula (Gaussian, Archimedean or Student), it is possible to generate samples according to copula's structure.

Gaussian Copula Sampling
------------------------

We suppose that our copula is a gaussian :math:`\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)` where :math:`\Sigma` is the covariance matrix. Before sampling new variables from quantile functions, we are required to compute the correlation matrix :math:`P` as follow :

.. math::
	P=\sqrt{\text{Diag}(\Sigma)}^{-1} \Sigma \sqrt{\text{Diag}(\Sigma)}^{-1}

According to the process, we extract the Cholesky triangular matrix :math:`L` such that :math:`P=L L^{\top}`. Finally, sampling gaussian copula is now easily possible.

* Sample :math:`Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I_d)`
* Compute :math:`V=LZ`
* Apply quantile function to :math:`V`
